Best Practices
• Use Implicit Waits for a basic, global wait time for all elements. This can be set once and is useful for dealing with simple loading times.
• Use Explicit Waits for more complex scenarios where specific conditions must be met. This ensures that your test is responsive and efficient.
• Avoid time.sleep except in rare cases where you need a hard pause, such as when debugging or when dealing with non-UI-related delays.
